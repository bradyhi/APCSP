    <p>1) One of my favorite projects so far was my Westward expansion project from 5th grade. It was one of the first papers I ever wrote and will always have a special place in my heart. I wrote about the Alamo and the Transcontinental Railroad. </p>

    <p>2) the second project I have done was my I search freshman year. This project is notable to me because it is unfiinished. Unofortunaly covid made us stop early so we didnt get to finish our research. I was writing about money in soccer and where it goes and how its made. It was very interesting.</p>
